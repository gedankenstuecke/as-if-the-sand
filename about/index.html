The vast, fertile plains of the Argentinean Pampa led British officer Francis Bond Head to remark that <em>“the country has
no striking features, but it possesses like all the works of nature, ten thousand beauties.”</em>, when he traveled through
the Argentinean Pampa in the 1800s. European immigration into the Pampa intensified soon after – thanks to large amounts
of farm land and government-sponsored schemes for settlers to start farms.
</p>
<p>
As part of these programs, the Argentinean government supported the development of railroads, aiming to ensure that no
farm would be more than 20 kilometers from a train station and leading to numerous <em>boom towns</em> being incorporated across
the Pampa in the places where new stations were being built. But, with a shift from transport – freight and passenger –
from rail to road, many of these train lines stopped their service starting in the 1930s. This change in transportation,
alongside the general growth in industrialization led to many of these former boom towns shrink to become small hamlets,
as people moved to larger and more connected cities.
</p>
<p>
Today, many of these villages are at the risk of becoming extinct. Which doesn’t keep the remaining population from
taking pride in and celebrating their homes in bespoke ways, letting travelers passing by know about their existence
through artisanal town signs, gates and other structures, such as the now repurposed train stations that serve as
museums or cultural centers that teach traditional dances & arts.
</p>
<p>
Through our ongoing work on <em>“as if the sand were stone”</em>, we aim to document some of these towns, villages & hamlets
across the Pampa alongside their <em>“ten thousand beauties”</em> and how their sense of place shifts and adapts as the world
around them evolves.
